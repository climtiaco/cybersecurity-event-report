                                                <h1>2016 Cybersecurity Presidential Campaign Report</h1>

    The cybersecurity attack that occurred during the 2016 presidential election not only sparked up a ton of controversary within the nation, but also led the U.S. Government to big investigations to find the person who leaked sensitive information from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to the public via Wikileaks. According to the report, Russian hackers were able to penetrate the DNC's computer network by sucessfully phishing information from campaign chairman, John Podesta. From this seamingly small error on chairman Podesta's part, it lead to what is known now as one of the most significant cyber attacks in history. 

    The three most obvious cyber attck tactics used in this event were phishing, spearphishing and malware. Phishing at first just because the potential threat could've been picked up, warned about and avoided had the DNC listened to the FBI agents that informed them before all these attacks began, that one of their computers had beeen compromised. From their succession with the phishing, the Hackers were able to further their mission by creating a fake email account using the stolen information to further penetrate the DNC. 

    The Hackers sent spearphishing emails to more than thirty Clinton staffers, which contained an embedded a link to a document. That document link then took that computer over to a website operated by the hackers. After receiving more stolen information from the malware they used, they gained access to 33 DNC computers and the attack continues for another five or six years rolling into the next presidential election between Trump vs Biden. 

    In conclusion, the type of attacks that were used were ultimately phishing, spearphishing and malware. The vulnerability was originally discovered by the FBI, according to the beggining of the article, but through further research, a company called CrowdStrike did investigations as well as U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Election Security. The vulnerability was discovered through John Podesta. The attackers exploited as much as they could, eventuall gaining access to the DNC network. This whole attack could've been prevented, had John Podesta and his appointed staffer, been more careful about checking their email. <348 Words>



                                                        <h1>Ukraine Ransomware</h1>
    This article described the events of what happened in 2017 during a cyber attack on a Ukrainian tax-filing software. This global cyber-attack affected multiple companies in different countries including the United States, Russia and Great Britain, to name a few.  While affecting many, the attack itself did not do a lot of harm, judging from the context of the article but had an effect on everyone who was contaminated with the ransomware that was downloaded to their computers. 

    The attack began with a Ukrainian tax-filing company's automatic software updates getting hacked into thus being able to insert the ransomware onto every computer it wanted to that used the automatic update feature for the program. Automatic update tools are such a common feature that it made this attack very clever to use. Professionals who did further research into the attack couldn't reveal if the attack was for money or targeted at Ukraine or those doing business with it. Nonetheless, the attack was successful in setting up the ransomware that it did.

    Being that the attack was successful, no further information was given about what type of ransomware this attack held. No information on whether they encrypted everyone's files and held the files ransom for a specific amount of money. Other ransomware tactics would be to act as if they were holding their information ransom but then in all acuality, they had not encrypted and ransomed the files. Within the artcle, there's a video on the further details of how ransomware scenarios take place. In this video, they also break down the fact that the ransomware owners could also threaten your files by deleting them if you don't give them the ransom they're looking for (hence where the name comes from).

    In conclusion, the attack was successful in setting up the ransomware that it did. It ultimately could've been prevented had the Ukrainian tax-filing company been more careful about their cybersecurity protection. Through this experience with the Ukrainian company, it teaches the entire world that your personal attention to detail won't only be benefited from you, but benefited by all! Luckily, the attackers didn't exploit any of the ransomware any further than where they got to (according to the article).
